Learn Goals was made over the course of four days for a Hackathon project!

Learn Goals is a Google Chrome extension that helps you save and categorize self-education resources. 
You can also see resources you have completed to track your progress.

If I were to do this project over, I would reorganize the files with RESTful apis in their own folder
and axios requests on the frontend.
